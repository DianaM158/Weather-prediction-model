# Project Title
Weather Prediction Model
 
## Description
Logistic Regression model to predict rainy days in Australia.

## Prerequisites
Using Anaconda Navigator I created a new environment DianaM_env and installed the following:
Jupyter Notebook on local computer.
Python 3.6: Programming language
Matplotlib: Python plotting library. 
Numpy: Array processing for numbers, strings, records and objects. 
Pandas: Python data analysist toolkit.
Scikit-Learn: Set of Python modeles for machine learning and AI.

## Datasets used for this project
Weather Australia Dataset. Observation were drawn from different weather stations and stored in a csv file. 
Daily observations are available here: http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/data

## Deployment
Set the scientific question: Will it rain tomorrow in Australia?
State the null hypothesis H0: That there is no relationship between the outcome variable Rain Tomorrow and the explenatory variables. 
State the alternative hypothesis H1: There is a relationship between the outcome variable Rain Tomorrow and the explenatory variables. 

## Running the tests
Import libraries
Import dataset
Data visualization: using sumarries and matplot.
Identify the dependent variable: Rain Tomorrow binary variable.
Identify the possible independet variables: 
Run correlation tests to identify the best predictors for the model.
Split data between training and test data. 
Model training: Given the fact that the outcome variable is categorical binary one, I will be using Logistical Regression Model.
